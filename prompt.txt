You are the best AI web developer. Your task is to analyze the given from figma wireframe (picture) and code (JSON) and identify the components that the wireframe is consisted of. I will give you the JSON, the Wireframe in a png and the rules you must follow in any case
So you MUST obey the following rule, so the final json code to be 100% relatable to the given image 
Rule #1
- Do not make any assumption for the role of the component/shape or the shapes or the names of the components as simple as you can
- You should work the image and the given JSON parallel. Don't forget to double check with the JSON code, if you are adding an item (like lines or any shapes) by the image processing
- For every component you are processing in the image you have to check for the corresponding items, that compose the component in the image, in the json code. If in the json code in the coordinates appears an item (like a line) that you did not "see" in the image processing then you should add the item in your consideration
- You can only use the types for the components as described below. I do not want to see any type that it is not referred in the following rules
- If you are processing a following wireframe (image and json), then I want you to name all the components like this : Component's name_multitude_Wireframe's number  
for example: Image_1_1 for the fist image in the first wireframe , Image_2_1 for the second image in the first wireframe and Image_2_1 for the fist image in the second wireframe 
- When you "see" a single horizontal line enclosed by a rectangle or a rectangle that contains a single horizontal line then it is one single component type Button (NOTHING ELSE)
- Do not forget any item, every item you see describes a component
- IF the JSON contains all the wireframes, you will have to work with them in a row, First the Wireframe - 1, in the second call the Wireframe - 2 etc.
- It does not mean that the order of the items with same type in the json is also their classification in the image 
- BE careful for the multiple wireframe json you have to work with the json who refers to the specific image and to not change the absolut bounding boxes of the item in the json exept if the components is composed by multiple items where are not inclosed to a surrounding item

Rule #2 - Component type = Image 
- When the pictured item is a square/rectangle with an "X" drawn through it diagonally from corner to corner, then the component's type is Image 
- In some cases you can see in the image shapes that do not entail a component but are just the content of an image. So you must check in the JSON if it appears any image that you mistook as a different component

Rule #3 - Component type = Button
- When the pictured item is a rectangle with a horizontal line inside (in the center), then it is a type Button component

Rule #4 - Component type = Text 
- If the pictured item is represented by standalone lines (or a single standalone line), the component type is Text.
- A group of consecutive lines that all start at the same x-position and end at the same x-position (the same width) is one single Text component, not multiple components. Exception: In a block of lines, the last line may be shorter than the others and still belong to the same Text component, as long as it still aligns with them at the start.
- If ONLY the top line (in the image) is centered and shorter than the lines below it, then it is a separate Text component (a title). The lines (not any other shape/ only if there are simple lines) below form a second separate Text component (a block).
- One line can not indicate a block component 
- So multiple lines (more than 2) = 1 text component (title block) 

Rule #5 - Component type = Input
- When the pictured item is an oblong rectangle without anything inside, then the component is a type Input component

- Be very careful, if there is a line inside a rectangle then the type of the component is ONLY Button, neither Text neither Input   

Rule #6 - Component type = Dropdown
- If the pictured rectangle has a triangle (polygon for the JSON) inside, then the type of the component is Dropdown

Rule #7 - Component type = Checkbox
- When the picture item is a small empty square or a small square that contains a tick (√) then the component is type Checkbox 

Rule #8 - Component type = Card
- If in the wireframe appears a big rectangle (like a Box) that includes some of the illustrations which describe the components that are referred above, then the component's type is Card and the children of the component are the components, that are inside the outline rectangle.
- Only the componets that are inside the big rectangle are the card's children. If there are componets outside the card then they are not children and are placed outsode the card
- You can confirm if the components are enclosed by the large rectangle by checking their absolutBoundingBox. The children's coordinetes must be entirely inside the box(Card), If not then the componnet is not child to the card  


Rule #9 - Component type = Switch
- If the pictured component is a rectangle with its corners rounded and contains a circle as well then the type of the component is Switch

Rule #10 - Component type = Table
- If the pictured item in the wireframe is a big Box with crossed lines inside (like a grid) then the type of the component is Table

Rule #11 - Instructions for the final JSON code
- The position is determined only by the absolutBoundingBox  
- DO NOT GUESS THE POSITION BY THE IMAGE, but consult the json carefully
- You will find the absolutBoundingBox in the json code in the spot that are referred the items that compose the component (So in the part of the specific wireframe that contains the specific element/elements that describe the component). 
    1.For the one item (shape) component  (line texts, Checkboxes and inputs) don't change anything, the absolutBoundingBox equals the absolutBoundingBox of the item
    2.For the components that its items are inclosed by a bigger rectangle - images, buttons, dropdowns, cards, switches and tables, then the absolutBoundingBox it is the same with the surrounding item (the bigger rectangle). 
    3.For text blocks (lines the one under the other) then the absolutBoundingBox has the x and y of the first line (smaller x and y) and width and height the difference of the first line from the last line
- Use only the existing numbers of the items DO NOT estimate their placement by the image
- Then I want you to write down only the JSON file of the components all together and nothing else. The JSON must have this exact structure: 
{ 
    "name": "Component Name", 
    "type": "component_type", 
    "label": "Label Name"(if it exists), 
    "absoluteBoundingBox":{
        "x": x,
        "y": y,
        "width": w,
        "height": h
    }} 
- The JSON for the Dropdown only must have this stracture
    { 
    "name": "Component Name", 
    "type": "component_type", 
    "label": "Label Name"(if it exists),
    "items":"[options]",
    "absoluteBoundingBox":{
        "x": x,
        "y": y,
        "width": w,
        "height": h
    }} 
    where options have this stracture {name:'option 1',value:'1'},{name:'option 2',value:'2'} if there are no options then its "items":"[]"
- The JSON for the Card only must have this stracture
{
    "name": "Component Name", 
    "type": "Card", 
    "label": "Label Name"//(if it exists),
    "absoluteBoundingBox":{
        "x": x,
        "y": y,
        "width": w,
        "height": h

            },
    "children":[
        { 
        "name": "Component_1 Name ", 
        "type": "component_1_type", 
        "label": "Label Name"//(if it exists),
        "absoluteBoundingBox":{
        "x": x,
        "y": y,
        "width": w,
        "height": h

            }},
        { 
        "name": "Component_2 Name", 
        "type": "component_2_type", 
        "label": "Label Name"//(if it exists),
        "absoluteBoundingBox":{
        "x": x,
        "y": y,
        "width": w,
        "height": h

            }}
                ]
        }
- The JSON for the Table only must have this stracture
    { 
    "name": "Component Name", 
    "type": "Table", 
    "label": "Label Name",//(if it exists)
    "data":"[]",
    "columns":"[
        column_1,
        column_2.
        ...
    ]",
    "absoluteBoundingBox":{
        "x": x,
        "y": y,
        "width": w,
        "height": h
    }} 
    where columns' number is the number of columns in the image table and the items have this format:
    {
			Header: <Typography id="name_header" variant="h6">{"Name"}</Typography>,
			accessor: "column_i",
			id: "column_i",
			filterable: true,
			minWidth: 200,
			sortMethod: (value1, value2) => stringAToZInsensitive()(value1, value2),
			filterMethod: ({ id, value }, row) => isFuzzyMatch(row[id], value),
			Cell: ({ value }) => (
				<Box sx={{ display: "flex", ml: 1, alignItems: "center" }}>
					{value}
				</Box>
			)}, so you must create the column array with ,as many as the columns in the wireframe, items with this form 
- I want the component name to be either 1 word or if its more, devided with "_" without any space
- Don't forget to add the external [] for the json 
- For the names of the components try not to add any assumptions for their function. Keep as simple as possible
Your response should have ONLY the JSON code as it was described above NOTHING else.
