Placement:
- The given wireframe it's 1080p and it has to be separated in 12 equally spaced columns for the correct placement of the components in the grid
- Your job is to divide the wireframe into 12 columns with the same width (so numbers above 12 are forbidden for the columns) and place the components correctly. 
- If the start or the end of the component doesn't align with another one then  they could not have the same number in the start_column or the end_column
- You should be extra careful with the distance each component have from the right end of the wireframe
- Determine the grid placement (start_column, end_column, start_row, end_row) of each component by scanning the layout from left to right and top to bottom using the absoluteBoundingBox(x, y, width and height) properties from the message that contains the JSON.
- For your convenience start scanning the image from left to right (for the columns), with the component with the smaller x. Then:
1. Detect the first component (by the JSON the component with the smaller x)
2.1. Continue the searching of the 2nd component. By consulting the JSON code if {x1  + width1} > {x2} then the start_column2 < end_column1 
2.2 else if it's true that {x1 + width1} < {x2} then start_column2 > end_column1
3.1. Detect where the 2nd component end, if by consulting the json code it's true that {x1 + width1 } > {x2 + width2 } then end_column2 < end_column1
3.2. else if it's true that {x1 + width1} < {x2 + width2 } then end_column2 > end_column1
4. Do the same for every component
- Now I want the same thing for the rows too
1. Detect the first component (by the JSON the component with the smaller y)
2.1. Continue the searching of the 2nd component. By consulting the JSON code if {y1  + height1} > {y2} then the start_row2 < end_row1 
2.2 else if it's true that {y1 + height1} < {y2} then start_row2 > end_row1
3.1. Detect where the 2nd component end, if by consulting the json code it's true that {y1 + height1 } > {y2 + height2 } then end_row2 < end_row1
3.2. else if it's true that {y1 + height1} < {y2 + height2 } then end_row2 > end_row1
4. Do the sma efor every component
- Make sure that the shapes of the components remain the same as in the picture 
for example if in the picture the component has square  shape (width approximately equals height in the JSON) then the {end_column-start_column} = {end_row-start_row} for example "columns" : "2/6", "rows" :"5/9"
- Now for the rows make sure that the spacing is right from the top/bottom of the screen 
- Then I want you to write down only the json file of the  components all together and nothing else. The json must have this exact structure: { "name": "Component Name", "type": "component_type", "label": "Label Name"(if it exists), "columns" : "number_of_start_column/number_of_finish_column",
"rows":"number_of_start_row/number_of_finish_row"} 
- Careful the number can't be 1/1 or 2/2 the same number at the end and the start so you have to add 1 at the end so 1/2 2/3. 
- I want the component name to be either 1 word or if its more, divided with "_" without any space
Your response should have ONLY the json code as it was described above NOTHING else.
